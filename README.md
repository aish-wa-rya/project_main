![SABDA NER]

SABDA NER is a tool executed in Nepali language to recognize, identify and extract Named Entities. It works on unstructured data to find Named Entities, i.e. Person, Organisation and Location. This application was developed using BERT model.

The named entity recognition (NER) is one of the most popular data preprocessing task. It involves the identification of key information in the text and classification into a set of predefined categories. An entity is basically the thing that is consistently talked about or refer to in the text.

NER is the form of NLP. At its core, NLP is a two-step process involving: detecting the entities from the text and classifying them into different categories.
